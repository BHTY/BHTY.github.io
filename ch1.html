<p><strong>No Win Scenario<br />Chapter 1: Betrayal</strong></p>
<p>"The negotiations were jeopardized by the crash-landing of the Doctor's TARDIS, but once word of The Master's ultimate demise reached Skaro, the negotiations were secured."</p>
<p>Romana hated little more than she hated High Council meetings, she thought to herself, as she glanced across from the head of the council table in the ornately decorated chambers - first at the tall, thin, fair-haired man that was her formidable Vice President Tantalus - then at the tall, pale woman with flowing black hair that was High Chancellor Livia, then at Arandus, the wizend old man, shrunken in form and in his last regenerations but still a respected Castellan, and finally at Councillor Padrac, a young, handsome man still in his third regeneration.</p>
<p>The most junior member of the Supreme Council of the Time Lords, Padrac remained a well-liked politican among the Prydonian ranks. In fact, at the table she sat, every single one of them was a Prydonian, save for Arandus, an Arcalian by birth. And besides Arandus, they all wore their flowing robes - Arandus always remained dressed in his uniform.</p>
<p>"This is still a disturbing lapse in procedure, Lady President," Tantalus said. "For such a decision as this, you should have sought the Council's approval."</p>
<p>"I am the President. I need to seek no one's approval. And the chance to make peace with the Daleks is not one that comes twice. I was not about to abandon it while the Cardinals debate," Romana quickly replied. Not a career politician like most of her peers at the table, she was still growing used to the skill of phrasing her contempt diplomatically. "The Master had been a thorn in both our side and theirs for centuries - perhaps from here we can forge a new path."</p>
<p>Livia narrowed her eyes. "That raises another issue, Lady President. How do we know that The Master is truly dead? Need I remind you that once before, we thought The Master was dead, but he survived and appropriated another new body."</p>
<p>Arandus remained quiet, as Padrac glanced around the table. "There's another angle to consider here," Padrac began. "What will the other Temporal Powers think of this?"</p>
<p>"Indeed," Tantalus said. "They're no friends of the Daleks."</p>
<p>"I'm certain that they will see it our way, once they realize that our peace with the Daleks could extend to them as well."</p>
<p>"I still remain unconvinced that the Daleks are capable of peace," Arandus said, finally addressing the Council. "This merely seems like a stall so that they can improve their time-travel technology until they're ready to challenge us."</p>
<p>"They already constructed a duplicate of our own time capsules once," Livia said. "And used that technology to build the Time Destructor."</p>
<p>Livia was referring of course to the Kembel Incident, when the Daleks had allied themselves with the Guardian of the Solar System, Mavic Chen, to obtain the necessary supply of the rare mineral Taranium to build a temporal weapon capable of accelerating the flow of time.</p>
<p>"These are all issues that can be addressed at the negotiation table," Romana admitted. "But it's important that we first get to the table."</p>
<p>There was a brief pause - the Time Lords seemed unmoved by her urging, until Livia finally spoke up.</p>
<p>"We will go along with you, Lady President."</p>
<p>Her wording was ominous - but the others at the Council table quickly nodded their agrgeement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aboard Time Station Epsilon, security was no laughing matter - the preparations for the Lady President's arrival were taken seriously and with the utmost professionalism. As brown-shirted technicians crossed paths with Chancellery Guards in their red and white uniforms, they were stopped at frequent security checkpoints to have their identities verified - nothing was to be left to chance.</p>
<p>The installation rested outside of the spacetime continuum, inside of the space-time vortex, which was a quite beautiful sight, thought young Commander Loran, as he stared out the window of his office, as security team leader.</p>
<p>Commander Loran was young, only two-hundred-and-three, and it showed, as despite his tall stature, he had a boyish complexion to complement his smooth dark hair, but like every Chancellery Guard, had been handpicked during the Academy from one of Gallifrey's most prestigious families.</p>
<p>He chuckled to himself while musing about the peace negotiations about to take place. <em>"Those saltshakers will sow for peace if they knew what's good for them... but I find it hard to believe that Romana's 'new age' is really in our future..."</em></p>
<p>He was suddenly distracted from his musing as his door buzzed. He turned around and it slid open, revealing Lieutenant Telon. Telon was even younger than Loran, being a fresh-faced and shorter blonde-haired guard, but had proven himself to be quite dependable. Telon handed over a data pad to Loran, who accepted it, taking it into his hands to look over the data on it, written in Gallifreyan script.</p>
<p>"This looks acceptable..." Loran said, nodding and handing the pad back. "Inform Gallifrey that we are ready for the arrival of the Lady President and her delegation."</p>
<p>Telon smiled as he took the pad back. "The President's own guards will be with her for the duration... I've already assigned men to take care of security arrangements for the Daleks. Guards have been posted at sensitive areas."</p>
<p>"Excellent work, Telon. Efficient as ever."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>Loran smiled slightly at Telon's earnest enthusiasm for his work. He couldn't help but share it - even the most dull of security work preparing for the peace talks certainly beat Capitol patrol. "Dismissed."</p>
<p>Telon nodded and left, the door sliding shut behind him, leaving Loran alone again with his thoughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Romana glanced around the sterile white walls of her travel capsule uneasily. TARDISes made for simple transport like this one had no soul, no personality, she thought to herself, as she walks the glowing time column slide up and down - nothing like an old "obsolete" Type 40 she had once grown to love. Still, she thought, any trip off-world was a rare and welcome opportunity. Since returning from E-Space, she had retained the determination to make a difference that she had learned from The Doctor, and these talks certainly presented an unmissable opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>A light on the console suddenly switched from yellow to green, indicating that they were now being operated by Time Station Epsilon's remote traffic control.</p>
<p>Romana's own guards - six of them - were at the controls of her TARDIS, while her guard commander, Valdeth, stood at her side.</p>
<p>Valdeth was a female guard, standing at Romana's same height, and was young, attractive, long, flowing brown hair - the new face of Gallifrey was not one of stodgy old men, nor stuffy academics.</p>
<p>One of the guards hit a button on the console and the shutter screen on the wall rolled down to show their destination, rapidly enlarging to take up more of the scanner as they approached it.</p>
<p>"Lowering outer Transduction Barrier..." came Lieutenant Telon's voice, through the speaker on the console. "Raising Outer Transduction Barrier, you are now in security zone."</p>
<p>The TARDIS slowed to a halt, the time column stopping but remaining lit. A flashing light on the console indicated that they were being scanned. A few seconds later, the light went out and the time column went into motion again.</p>
<p>"Lowering inner transduction barrier," Telon's voice said. "You are cleared to materialize in the TARDIS Bay."</p>
<p>The guard at the piloting controls flicked a few switches and the shutter screen closed once again. Seconds later, a familiar wheezing-groaning sound filled the control room as they landed...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Romana smiled, glad to finally stretch her legs as she stepped out of the TARDIS out into the landing bay of the Time Station. While it was similarly sterile, any change of scenery was welcome - transport TARDISes weren't that much bigger on the inside, and their flight had been extremely slow. No pilot wanted to be the one for whom the President was injured on their watch, so they tended to overdo the caution.</p>
<p>Waiting for her, as her guards stepped out in tow, was Commander Loran, awaiting greeting her. "Welcome to Time Station Epsilon, Lady President."</p>
<p>Romana nodded gracefully. "Thank you, Commander."</p>
<p>Loran and Valdeth nodded at each other and the party of eight walked into the hallway, headed down through the corridors.</p>
<p>"You'll be pleased to know that the Dalek delegation is already on their way. You'll be speaking with the Dalek Imperator, a member of their Supreme Council."</p>
<p>"I see," Romana said. "Not the Imperator Prime?"</p>
<p>"No," Loran explained. "Since the destruction of the Dalek mothership during the Shoreditch Incident, the power void left by the Emperor Dalek has been killed by his most senior adjutant - the Imperator Prime."</p>
<p>Romana looked on sheepishly as they turned a corner through the metallic corridors. While she had painstakingly studied such issues in order to prepare, it seemed that in her rush, she had missed this crucial detail. "Who now has his own Imperator..."</p>
<p>"Yes, Lady President," Loran said. "You'll be meeting in the Conference Room. If you need anything, use any of the comm panels to reach one of my men. They're handpicked, the best guards on Gallifrey.</p>
<p>Valdeth smirked at Loran - after all, how were Loran's guards supposed to be the best if it were hers than the Lady President handpicked? They stopped in front of a room, with a plain metal door.</p>
<p>"This is your room, Lady President. There are facilities here to rest, produce food, bathe, and anything else that you may need."</p>
<p>"Very kind, Commander," Romana said. She then nodded, and Loran walked off. Romana looked into a retinal scanner and the door to her room quickly slid open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Telon breathed a sigh of relief as he stepped out of Epsilon's control room. With the arrival of the Lady President completed, he was on break from the stressful duties of station security until the Daleks arrived.</p>
<p>As he passed through the corridors, most guards stopped to salute him. Telon briefly acknowledged each by nodding and smiling, but really he just wanted to get back to his quarters to rest - even the seemingly boundless energy of youth does in truth have its limits, as the Lady President had been reminded several times during her political career.</p>
As Telon neared his quarters, he moved away from the areas where there was much action - or many people - and suddenly heard a clang. He immediately froze, looking around. He turned around and saw that it had come down a hallway. Placing a hand on his staser, he walked down the hallway to see what was going on and investigate.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Remember," Loran began, addressing the majority of his force of guards, who were all lined up in the station's control room. "We may be negotiating with these Daleks, but they're still Daleks, so we will treat them as a potentially hostile force. This is the sequence of events. The Dalek ship approaches. We lower the Outer Transduction Barrier. We then lead them inside and raise the Outer Transduction Barrier. We then transmat their delegation aboard the observation pod. Make sure their gunsticks are not attached, and scan for any other weapons. We then raise the external barrier around the observation pod, lower the internal barrier, and transmat them to the main section. Any questions?" Loran briefly scanned the room, but no one seemed to have any questions. "Lieutenant Telon will be in charge of operations here."</p>
<p>Loran scanned the room once again, realizing that Loran was nowhere to be seen. "Anyone seen Loran?"</p>
<p>"I saw him headed to his room a while back," one of the guards offered.</p>
<p>"I see..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, Telon bolted in. "Sorry I'm late."</p>
<p>Loran was slightly off guard at Telon's tardiness, but decided it was a question for later. "I was just running through our security procedures, Lieutenant."</p>
<p>"Ah, good. Sorry... I'm ready."</p>
<p>"Excellent," Loran said. "I'll leave you to it then."</p>
<p>Loran walked off, gesturing for two of the guards to flank him, following him out of the control room of the Time Station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dalek battlecruiser approaching Time Station Epsilon was hardly what one would consider a ship of peace, but its mission was at least notionally one of diplomacy. Hardly known for their aesthetic sense, the black communications room in which the white-and-gold Dalek Imperator stood was drab, dark, lit only by several glowing control orbs and screens. The Imperator stood alone in the communications room, connected via video link to the Dalek Mothership, commanded by the Imperator Prime, distinguished by its gold top piece.</p>
<p>"WE ARE NEARING THE TIME STATION--" the Imperator screeched.</p>
<p>"YOU WILL APPEAR TO COMPLY WITH THEIR PROCEDURES. ONCE ABOARD, EXTERMINATE ANY UNNECESSARY PERSONNEL AND DUPLICATE THE PRESIDENT ROMANA AND HIGH-RANKING GUARDS! GALLIFREY WILL BE UNPREPARED--"</p>
<p>"I OBEY!" the Imperator responded, extending its manipulator arm to actuate the controls, terminating the connection. Already, the battle computer onboard the Imperator's casing was running through several possible scenarios that could occur while executing the plan - all of them ending in Dalek victory, as the battlecruiser entered the Time Station's exclusion zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Daleks board and there's a brief pretense of talks before the Daleks start blasting</li>
<li>Several of Romana's guards are hit but she and a few others escape - comms are down and several more Daleks board the station</li>
<li>Romana and her guards realize that they can't make it back to the TARDIS</li>
<li>Loran manages to make his way to Romana and her guards, they discuss a plan to reach the communications system and call for help manually</li>
<li>Telon arrives - who promptly turns on them</li>
<li>The Daleks arrive and Loran shoots Telon. The Daleks take Romana and the others into custody but Valdeth and Himonus (one of Romana's other guards) manage to make a run for it, with Daleks chasing them</li>
<li>Romana and the others are taken for processing but Valdeth, Himonus, and a few other surviving guards mount a sneak attack - but Himonus is forced to take a blast meant for Romana</li>
<li>As they near the communications room, most of Romana's guards (leaving just Romana, Valdeth, and Loran) try to lead the Daleks off in the other direction, but in the end Loran is forced to sacrifice himself to hold off the Daleks as Romana and Valdeth manage to get the communications system working again</li>
<li>Immediately, a TARDIS materializes both inside and outside the Time Station - the one outside obliterates the Dalek ship while Castellan Arandus takes a squad of Chancellery Guards to take care of the Daleks</li>
<li>Romana returns to Gallifrey and immediately has a meeting with Vansell (who intentionally delayed, frustrating Romana), demanding to know why the Matrix didn't warn them that the Daleks already had operatives aboard Epsilon. Vansell admits that it's been clouded lately</li>
<li>Romana thinks to herself that she knew all of their names as she watches Tantalus give a speech to the Patraxee assembly about Romana's weakness</li>
</ul>
