<title>Will Klees ePortfolio</title>


<p>I am Will Klees, also commonly known under my screen-name&nbsp;<em>captainwillstarblazer</em>, and welcome to my home page. I'm primarily interested in developing software for retro platforms, including old-school PCs and occasionally game consoles such as the Nintendo GBA. In conjunction with this, I'm fascinated by the history of personal computers, particularly in the 80s and 90s, so I often do lots of reverse-engineering projects and other assorted historical endeavours.</p>
<p>I have been featured multiple times as a guest writer for Neozeed's <a href="https://virtuallyfun.com">VirtuallyFun</a> blog, and am also an avid reader of Michal Necasek's <a href="https://os2museum.com">OS/2 Museum</a> blog, and Raymond Chen's <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">The Old New Thing</a>.&nbsp;</p>
