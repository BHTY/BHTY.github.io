<p style="color:white;">Starblazer is a series of 3D space-combat flight simulators developed for old retro MS-DOS personal computers, a series I have worked on between late 2021 and the present day. It was inspired primarily by my longtime love for Nintendo's Star Fox series, which was a series of space combat games made for several of Nintendo's consoles, but has also taken inspiration from other series such as Wing Commander, Star Wars: X-Wing (both early 90s 3D space combat flight sims for MS-DOS PCs) and the Star Wars vector arcade game from 1983 by Atari. Some of the Starblazer games feature the player flying on a more-or-less fixed path forward in a 3D world, facing enemies and obstacles, while others allow you to move freely in the 3D world, even engaging in dogfights with other players over the internet. One <a  href="https://starblazer.space/bsg/bsg.html">Starblazer-related game I developed</a> even runs in the browser, using techniques I learned from Starblazer's development but based on the Battlestar Galactica franchise.</p>

<p style="color:white;">Since I developed the entire software stack top-to-bottom without any frameworks, I learned about just every level of the software and hardware involved in creating my game engine from the ground up. For instance, I had to learn all of the math (primarily linear algebra) to render 3D graphics from scratch, giving me a deep understanding over how 3D graphics work at a very low level. When implementing the game's multiplayer functionality, I also learned how network sockets work, giving me a very deep understanding of networking technology. Additionally, since I was working directly with the metal, I learned a lot about the PCs hardware, since I was programming it directly, especially the display hardware (VGA). Finally, since the machines I was working with are so resource-constrained, to make the game run performantly, I had to learn a lot about optimization and writing efficient code to speed it up, particularly the math routines, even requiring assembly language, a skill that few programmers have nowadays.
