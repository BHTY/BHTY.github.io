<p>The original analog television systems utilized interlacing to maintain a high vertical refresh rate and vertical resolution. NTSC (525/60) would draw two fields of 240 lines on the odd and even scanlines of the screen, but due to phosphor and vision persistence, it appeared as a (semi-)stable image, though higher-quality TV sets could show flicker on interlaced content (hence, "flicker fixers" being an early term for de-interlacers), particularly with the 1024x768 43hz interlaced SVGA video mode.<br>
Broadcast television, VHS (and its contemporaries), LaserDisc, D-1, and DVD all utilized interlacing - alternating the odd/even lines. Early home computers and game consoles drew in a degenerate mode known as 240p, that was identical, but didn't alternate the lines, thereby giving a "scanline" effect, due to the blank lines between the actually-scanned lines. Starting with VGA in 1987 (really the IBM PGC in 1984),

<p>Converting interlaced video to progressive form can be dated at least back to the 1980s, when the first line doublers were released, designed to up-scan TV content for computer monitors and high-resolution video projectors. Since then, technology and computing power to present interlaced video on our modern displays has improved. Since most TV content is interlaced, and modern LCD panels are inherently progressive (they draw an entire frame at once, instead of in real time split into two separate sweeps), deinterlacing is needed.<br>
The most basic form of deinterlacing is known as weave deinterlacing. Weave deinterlacing merges two fields into a single frame, thereby preserving spatial resolution but compromising temporal resolution (think converting 480i60 -> 480p30). Weave deinterlacing can look quite good for still scenes, but when the two fields substantially differ, you get what are known as combing artifacts, where an object is in two different positions on every other line, and the 60i -> 30p conversion also compromises motion fluidity. To address the combing problem, a subset of weave known as blend deinterlacing averages every line pair, thereby compromising both spatial and temporal resolution (converting 480i60 to a 240p30 effective resolution.<br>
An extension of weave deinterlacing has found its way into many devices, and is known as double weave. Instead of converting 60i to 30p, it is converted to 60p by every frame being the current field and the preceding field, meaning that each field is shown twice - in two frames - frame 1 is fields 0 and 1, frame 2 is fields 1 and 2, frame 3 is fields 2 and 3, frame n is fields n-1 and n, etc. Double Weave retains motion fluidity, but still has the combing, though blend is still an option with double weave.<br>
Another popular form of deinterlacing is known as bob deinterlacing, and is arguably the most popular. In bob deinterlacing, each field is converted into a frame by doubling every line, thereby retaining motion fluidity and avoiding combing, but at the expense of some jagged edges due to the 480i60 -> 240p60 effective conversion. A subset of bob deinterlacing known as linear interpolation avoids this by, instead of doubling every line, every other line is the average of the two adjacent lines above and below, which helps to give the illusion of additional detail.<br>
Since many movies were converted from 24fps film to 60fps video (the 24fps -> PAL/SECAM conversion involves simply speeding up the film 4% to 25fps) using a technique known as 3:2 pulldown, the inverse telecine filter reverses this and recovers the original 24fps picture from a 60i video source. This is not applicable except for film sources. This is also not typically ideal for shows that were shot on film, but edited on video.<br>
The most advanced technique for deinterlacing is known as motion adaptive, and is generally seen in more advanced devices, and with more varying implementations. Most HDTVs and scalers include motion-adaptive deinterlacing, which buffers an entire frame. Motion-adaptive deinterlacing is capable of applying both the bob and weave techniques together for high-motion and low-motion parts of the screen, respectively, providing the best of both worlds, but it's computationally intensive.<br>

Many poor-quality video capture cards / digitizers perform a weave deinterlace including the common EasyCap devices. This reverses the filter. Also has a ddweave program to reverse a double weave filter. Many decent capture cards misdetect 240p (480i, really, but without the half scanline to offset the odd/even lines that the image is scanned onto, causing the image to "double strike" the same lines) as 480i and introduce combing artifacts. This recovers the 240p image.<br>
